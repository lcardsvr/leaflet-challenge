# Leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

In this challenge a way to visualise USGS data was devised.

## Instructions

The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:

Part 1: Earthquake Visualisation

Part 2: Gather and Plot Tectonic Plate Data and plot it on top of the Earthquake Visualisation

## Bar Chart

The bar chart was created by taking a slice and reversing the data that matches a Test Subject ID number. The initial value is the first ID in the Array. The visualization matches the requirement. 

## Bubble Chart

The bubble chart was created by taking all the sample data that matches a Test Subject ID number. The initial value is the first ID in the Array. The visualization matches the requirement. 

## Metadata and Deployment

Metadata initialises without error. The Metadata updates when a new sample is selected. The App was successfully Deployed to Github Pages.
