# Leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

In this challenge a way to visualise USGS data was devised.

## Instructions

The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:

Part 1: Earthquake Visualisation

Part 2: Gather and Plot Tectonic Plate Data and plot it on top of the Earthquake Visualisation

## Part 1

The data from the last week thorugh the link "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson". Each point has displays the information for each EarthQuake which include Location, Date of occurrence, Magnitude, Latitude, Longitude and depth. The radius of each point relates to the magnitude of each event and the color to the depth. The color pallete used was taken from https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=RdPu&n=6

## Part 2

In addition to the visualisations in Part 1, the tectonic plate information from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json" was included.
